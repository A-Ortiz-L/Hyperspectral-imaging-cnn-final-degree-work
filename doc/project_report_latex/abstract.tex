{\bf \Huge Abstract}

\end{center}

The remote observation of the Earth has always been an object of interest for the human being.
Over the years, the methods used for this purpose have evolved until, at present, the analysis of hyperspectral images constitutes a very active line of research, especially
to monitor fires or prevent and monitoring natural disasters, chemical discharges or other types of environmental pollution.

Satellite images in a world where machine learning and data processing have advanced so much opens up the possibility of building models capable of recognizing areas where a natural
disaster has occurred and be able to act accordingly.

With the current computing power we can make data processing in real time so we can made decision to minimize damage, distribute emergency teams and optimize all the resources we have.
In recent years the field of data science has been able to create accurate models in sectors such as banking, industry, technology.
But the circle can only be complete if we can manage to place these models in an environment where they can be consumed productively and be useful outside the development and research scenario.

Maintaining all the hardware and software infrastructure to run our application is expensive, in the same way that hiring people with the necessary
knowledge to install and configure all these components.
The world has evolved so that it is no longer necessary to follow this behavior and we can choose suppliers that facilitate all these components as well as their maintenance, the cloud.

In this final degree project, the optimization in inference times of a machine learning model used to detect natural disasters with Openvino is carried out at the same time that the
deploy of the model in a google cloud environment, so that our service supports miles of requests per minute.
